            <h3>Eat smaller meals and snacks more frequently. Eating six or seven or eight times a day might be more easily tolerated than eating the same amount of food in three meals.
                Talk to your provider. Sometimes, poor appetite is due to depression, which can be treated. Your appetite is likely to improve after depression is treated.
                Avoid non-nutritious beverages such as black coffee and tea; instead choose milk and juices.Try to eat more protein and fat, and less simple sugars.
                Walk or participate in light activity to stimulate your appetite. Drink beverages after a meal instead of before or during a meal so you do not feel as full.Plan meals to include your favorite foods.Try eating the high-calorie foods in your meal first.
                Use your imagination to increase the variety of food you're eating.Take advantage of times of the day when your appetite is best. For example, some people have a better appetite in the morning and can eat a larger breakfast.Don't waste your energy eating foods that provide little or no nutritional value (such as potato chips, candy bars, colas and other snack foods).</h3>
